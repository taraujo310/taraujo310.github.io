Typed Thoughts is where I document the reasoning behind real engineering decisions.

Not just how code was written, but why it was written that way — and what almost went wrong along the way.

Here you'll find reflections on Git workflows, hotfixes, production pressure, and the subtle trade-offs that shape software systems.

Clear thinking. Practical lessons. Real-world context.
